# Cartojavi1

[https://cartojavi1.netlify.app/](https://cartojavi1.netlify.app/)

Demo application with Deck.gl and Carto Layers

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/49dddc15-8d11-4ace-848c-e8ce501575b7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cartojavi1/deploys)

## How to start development server

Run `nx serve cartojavi1` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Technical decissions, areas of improvement, technical debt and worth of mention

### Stack

- Deck.gl: Map component
- React, redux, redux-toolkit: Layer styles configuration and layer rendering are on different branches of the react tree. While we could do it without it, redux provides us with convenient helpers.
- Carto Layers: Data from Carto, initial configuration is on [src/App/layer/store/initialLayerState.ts](https://github.com/jacarma/cartojavi1/blob/main/src/App/layer/store/initialLayerState.ts)
- Mui and Styled Components: Ready to use components and css-in-js library
- Nx standalone react template: Alternative to CRA with vite and vitest, to quickstart the project

###Â Icon rendering

Icons render pixelated. The reason for that is that Cartolayer is replacing loadOptions and we can't provide the options for a better upscale algorithm. [See it on GitHub](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/blob/2eaabdd9fa46023544993359595e4171890d1b46/modules/carto/src/layers/carto-layer.ts#L314)

I would love to create a PR to fix this but I run out of time for this technical test.

### Layer styling

There are a lot of functionalities I didn't implement:

- Change from circles/icons in point layers
- Support for non thematic styles for polygon layers
- Themes based on lineColor instead of fillColor
- Thematic rendering of point layers
- Themes for the non tileset layers (I think we would need to query the statistics separately)
- Display legend for layers with thematic rendering

### Thumbnails in layer styles

I did a custom representation of symbols to preview them in the layer configuration widget.

While it works, I feel that deck.gl should probably provide a simpler option. It would be a good idea to investigate this further and replace the thumbnails if deck.gl provides them already.

### Performance

I was happy discovering that deck.gl is diffing the layers and not recreating all the map when the layers change. While I started memoizing the layers object and it's properties, I finally refactored these out.

See [Should I be Creating New Layers on Every Render?](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/using-layers.md#should-i-be-creating-new-layers-on-every-render) for more information.

To make deck.gl aware of the changes in accessor functions (getFillColor, getLineColor, getIcon...) I had to provide [updateTriggers](https://github.com/jacarma/cartojavi1/blob/d1714065fdfbc2b159a88972bdd19542613e0d8f/src/App/layer/getCartoLayerStyleProps.ts#L70)

I was not that happy when saw the bundle size. To improve the experience I did several things:

- Added a spinner to [index.html](https://github.com/jacarma/cartojavi1/blob/main/index.html)
- Extracted the map to another chunk and load it async
  - [Made the Map lazy](https://github.com/jacarma/cartojavi1/blob/d1714065fdfbc2b159a88972bdd19542613e0d8f/src/App/App.tsx#L10) and displayed a Skeleton while it loads
  - [Copy MAP_TYPES enum to my own code](https://github.com/jacarma/cartojavi1/blob/d1714065fdfbc2b159a88972bdd19542613e0d8f/src/App/layer/model.ts#L5) to prevent other references to deck.gl
- Removed moment.js timezones from the bundle

Most of the weight of the application is removed from the main bundle. And the UX improves because parts of the application load faster.

The size of the map chunk is still very high. There are parts of deck.gl and its dependencies we are not using and there may be a way not to load them. It's worth investigating it in the future.

### Testing

The most important cases are unit tested. More tests would be helpful, please see coverage result to identify the less tested spots with `npm run coverage`.
